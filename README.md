# Population structure using Bayesian modelling

This project is about the application of a Gibbs sampling on a Dirichlet-Multinomial mixture model using R. 

There are different phases to it:
* find data. In this case I just simulated it
* set parameters

In the code itself you will find more comments useful to understand the issue
